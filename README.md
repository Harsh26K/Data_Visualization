</p>

  <img src="https://github.com/Harsh26K/Data_Visualization/blob/main/images/CommentsvsViews.png" style="height:200px">
</div>

<p>
  As we can see, in terms of likes all groups have similar linear relationship.But, in terms of comments, BTS shares strong relationship than Blackpink and Twice.
</p>

<p>
  Now, lets analyse Social Engagement as whole but groupwise.
</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://github.com/Harsh26K/Data_Visualization/blob/main/images/SEperViews.png" style="height:200px">
</div>

<p>
  <li>Blackpink, Twice - The engagement is relatively constant and low, even with the increasing views</li>
  <li>BTS - The videos with less vies have more engagement and engagement decreases after certain amount of views</li>
</p>

## Comparisons:

<div>

  <img src="https://github.com/Harsh26K/Data_Visualization/blob/main/images/Avg.likes.png" style="height:200px">
  <img src="https://github.com/Harsh26K/Data_Visualization/blob/main/images/SE.png" style="height:200px">
</div>

<p>
  Now in terms of views, Blackpink takes the lead while in terms of likes and Social engagement, BTS is way ahead of rest two.
